# Hello World & Syntax

## What is PHP?

PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language primarily used for web development. PHP code is executed on the server and the result is sent to the browser as HTML.

## Basic Syntax

### PHP Tags

PHP code is enclosed in special tags:

```php
<?php
// Your PHP code here
?>
```

**Important Rules:**

- Every PHP file should start with `<?php`
- The closing `?>` is optional (and often omitted)
- PHP is case-sensitive for variables, but not for functions

### Your First PHP Program

```php
<?php
echo "Hello World!";
?>
```

### Output with echo

```php
<?php
// With echo (more commonly used)
echo "Hello World!";
echo "This is a new line<br>";

// Multiple values with echo
echo "Hello", " ", "World", "!";
?>
```

## Comments

```php
<?php
// Single-line comment

# Also a single-line comment (less common)

/*
   Multi-line comment
   Can span across
   multiple lines
*/

echo "Hello World!"; // Comment at the end of a line
?>
```

## Semicolons and Statements

```php
<?php
// Every statement ends with a semicolon
echo "First statement";
echo "Second statement";

// Multiple statements on one line (not recommended)
echo "A"; echo "B"; echo "C";
?>
```

## Case Sensitivity

```php
<?php
// Keywords, classes and functions are NOT case-sensitive
ECHO "This works";
Echo "This too";
echo "And this too";

// But: Variable names ARE case-sensitive!
$name = "Max";
$Name = "Anna";
echo $name;  // Output: Max
echo $Name;  // Output: Anna
?>
```

## Mixing HTML and PHP

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>PHP and HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1><?php echo "Welcome to my website!"; ?></h1>
    
    <p>This is regular HTML.</p>
    
    <?php
    echo "<p>This is HTML generated by PHP.</p>";
    ?>
    
    <p>Today is <?php echo date("Y-m-d"); ?></p>
</body>
</html>
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Simple Greeting

```php
<?php
echo "<h1>Welcome!</h1>";
echo "<p>Today is a beautiful day for programming.</p>";
?>
```

### Example 2: Display Current Date

```php
<?php
echo "Today is " . date("Y-m-d");
echo "<br>";
echo "Current time is " . date("H:i:s");
?>
```

### Example 3: Conditional Output

```php
<?php
$hour = date("H");

if ($hour < 12) {
    echo "Good morning!";
} elseif ($hour < 18) {
    echo "Good afternoon!";
} else {
    echo "Good evening!";
}
?>
```

## Common Beginner Mistakes

1. **Missing Semicolon**

```php
<?php
echo "Hello World" // Error: Missing semicolon
echo "Second line";
?>
```

2. **Missing Opening PHP Tag**

```php
echo "This won't work"; // Error: No <?php tag
?>
```

3. **Case Sensitivity Issues**

```php
<?php
$username = "John";
echo $Username; // Error: Variable doesn't exist (case-sensitive)
?>
```

## Best Practices

- Always use `<?php` opening tags (avoid short tags `<?`)
- End statements with semicolons
- Use meaningful comments
- Keep consistent indentation
- Don't close PHP tags at the end of PHP-only files

## Quick Reference

| Element | Syntax | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| PHP Tags | `<?php ... ?>` | `<?php echo "Hello"; ?>` |
| Output | `echo`, `print` | `echo "Hello World";` |
| Single Comment | `//` or `#` | `// This is a comment` |
| Multi Comment | `/* ... */` | `/* Multi-line comment */` |
| Statement End | `;` | `echo "Hello";` |

## Exercises

2. Write PHP code that shows the current date and time
3. Create a simple page that greets users based on the time of day
4. Practice mixing HTML and PHP to create a basic webpage
